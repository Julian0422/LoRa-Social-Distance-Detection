LoRa Social Distance Detection

Please keep enough social distance from others!
Today, I will share a LoRa project, the LoRa Social Distance Detection.
During the COVID-19, have you kept enough social distance from others?
The device is designed to maintain a social distance of 1.5 meters from others. People who are wearing the device get closer to 1.5 meters, a red LED lights up.

The project aims to measure the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) value and estimate the distance between the LoRa transceivers. The LoRa transceiver continuously sends and receives data to check the RSSI value from other transceivers. If the estimated distance exceeds 1.5m, the LED will light up.
