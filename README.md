LoRa Social Distance Detection

Please keep enough social distance from others!
Today, I will share a LoRa project, the LoRa Social Distance Detection.
During the COVID-19, have you kept enough social distance from others?
The device is designed to maintain a social distance of 1.5 meters from others. People who are wearing the device get closer to 1.5 meters, a red LED lights up.
